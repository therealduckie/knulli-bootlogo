# knulli-bootlogo

A bootlogo.bmp replacement for Knulli/Batocera that emulates a PC Bios boot screen in Photoshop format. Verified working for GIMP.

You must have The following font installed, before editing this file:

-----------

Edit this file to your own specs, save it as a BITMAP file as follows, including case sensitivity:

bootlogo.bmp

Save it to the root of your knulli/batocera boot drive.

NOTE: boot drive may differ, depending on your install type. For a single SD card, it should be placed in the /boot/ folder. On a 2 SD card install, the root of your batocera drive is fine. If there's any doubt, you will already fine a file by that name in the folder. Just overwrite it.

ENJOY!
